## ![](/public/images/favicon-32x32.png) What is Techbook?

## ‚öôÔ∏èUsage 
Techbook has two different types of users, Developer and a Recruiter. The Developer is given a Linkedin, Github and Portfolio link where other users can view their links. There is a section to add the tools, languages and frameworks they are familiar with. \
The user has an optional about me section where they can provide personal information. Then the majority of the user profile page consits of the users personal Github repositories, which are automatically generated. \
On the bottom there is a section to add the users main projects for recruiters to see what the user considers their best work. The last feature on the Developers profile page is the email option. An email of the user is automatically generated and anyone viewing the profile can email them directly and the comminication begins.
\
If the user is a Recruiter, they are given a limited page as Recruiters are not viewed by Developers. 
The last page is the Seach by page. The Recruiter can search out desired candicates and the Delopers seek out other developers.

## ![](/public/images/favicon-32x32.png) About Techbook

There are two profiles connected to this application, *LinkedIn* and there is a section to add a link to the users *portfolio*. This portfolio is shared with **Recruiters** and **users** alike. Users can generate ideas for their Portfolios by viewing different developers, which can generate new learning and ideas.\
\
The **Recruiter** can also see the **Developer‚Äôs** *LinkedIn* profile to gauge the desired employment and educational background. This information, coupled with the **Developers** own deployed Portfolio, creates a detailed picture of just how well of a fit a potential candidate really is. \
\
As a team we identified this exact problem, there is not a place that generates all the needed information for hiring managers. It is safe to say that this information can be gathered from a *resume*, however, a *resume* does not always create an accurate picture. This application brings together modern technology and a broader sense of the word resume. It is interactive and fun for users and **recruiters** alike.

Main Projects

## ‚≠ê STARS ‚≠ê
Every developer starts as a `üå†New Star` by default, users have the option to `star` a user profile `once a day` and if a users stars are more then 50, they become a `‚≠êBright Star`, and if its more then 100, they become a `üåüSuper Star`!

## üåêTechbook Organization
The motivation for our Techbook application was to allow new developers to meet, see each other‚Äôs work on Github and view profiles. One of the key elements of a new developers journey whether through a bootcamp or being self-taught, is to create a profile.\
This profile helps potential Recruiters view more information about candidates and whether they would make a good fit with their team. Our team decided on this application based on the fact we have a common interest of finding employment after the course has completed. When a group has a common interest, they tend to come together easier and have a vested interested in a desired outcome.

## üìäDevelopment & Progress

Learning in a group setting can sometimes be problematic. Different people have different ideas and different perceptions of how those ideas should be presented. Some of these problems were avoided as we all came together with a common interest and problem. A large portion of a developer‚Äôs career will be working in teams, understanding the dynamic of working with other people will be beneficial for future career success.\
The direction of the project changed midway, as it was determined that the main item for the design concept was unavailable. Originally the group had decided that having a third credited party, evaluate the user‚Äôs repositories through a created issue on GitHub was the best way to go. The group would have the instructor leave constructive feedback in an issue for the **developer**. This was quickly aborted as the ability to create an issue to a repository on *GitHub* has been disabled. Also, the group originally wanted to use the *LinkedIn* API to access members information, however, the only way to access the API is by creating an access token. The only way to get an access token is created an application on Microsoft developers page. Where, a developer must have a verified corporate LinkedIn profile to gain an access token to the API. \
Another issue that arose was determining which css framework the group was going to use. Searching for a framework was difficult as we first started with `Tailwind CSS` then realized that we would be better off if we selected one that would use components. The group ultimately decided on `Fomantic UI` as it had a vast library of easy to access syntax.
One feature that the group would like to add in the future is a messenger service within the application. This would create an even more interactive user experience.
